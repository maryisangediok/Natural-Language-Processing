NLP is used to analyze (3150,5) reviews to predict users' sentiments; 0=negative reviews, 1=positive reviews. Then we build and train ML classification models like Logistic Regression, Multinomial Naive Bayes, and XGBoost. We will also investigate the effects of resampling on the performance of the proposed models.  

## Goal
  Build, train, test and deploy ML model to predict sentiment from thousands of tweets. Sentiment analysis involves understanding users' opinions about a product or service
